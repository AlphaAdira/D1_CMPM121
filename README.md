# Adira's CMPM 121 D1 Project

For this project, I created a incremental game using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices.

# Things to add:

add a changing image to the page

1 click (started the game! [fangs] - nothing happens)

100 clicks (level up once [red eyes] - user clicks increase)

1000 clicks (level up again [white hair] - user clicks increase)

5000 clicks (level up again [new clothes] - user clicks increase)

new shops to create

250 - deconsecrate surrounding lands (adds 100/s)

1000 - create an animal farm (adds 250/s)

2500 - human sacrifices (adds 500/s)

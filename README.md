# Adira's CMPM 121 D1 Project

For this project, I created a incremental game using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices.

# Things I want to add from other people's games

- make shop items visible without them being available and not clickable when not available âœ…
  -- taken from various people check out everyone else's demos
- Make things make sounds when clicked on
  -- this idea was taken from mlau16's cat-themed clicker
- Make the background change colors (pulsing effect)
  -- this idea was taken from matthewkin's stars-themed clicker
- Make icons come off the button when clicked
- this idea was taken from mrpoopers's banana-themed clicker

# Things I wanted to add/change but didn't get to

### change images to ones made by me

### changing image icon on the top-left side of screen

- 1 cps (started the game! [fangs] - nothing changes)
- 100 cps (level up once [red eyes] - user drops per click increase)
- 500 cps (level up again [white hair] - user drops per click increase)
- 5000 cps (level up again [new clothes] - user drops per click increase)
